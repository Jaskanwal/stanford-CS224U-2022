    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework and associated bakeoff are devoted to supervised sentiment analysis using the ternary (positive/negative/neutral) version of the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-3) as well as a new dev/test dataset drawn from restaurant reviews. Our goal in introducing the new dataset is to push you to create a system that performs well in both the movie and restaurant domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The homework questions ask you to implement some baseline system, and the bakeoff challenge is to define a system that does well at both the SST-3 test set and the new restaurant test set. Both are ternary tasks, and our central bakeoff score is the mean of the macro-FI scores for the two datasets. This assigns equal weight to all classes and datasets regardless of size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SST-3 test set will be used for the bakeoff evaluation. This dataset is already publicly distributed, so we are counting on people not to cheat by developing their models on the test set. You must do all your development without using the test set at all, and then evaluate exactly once on the test set and turn in the results, with no further system tuning or additional runs. __Much of the scientific integrity of our field depends on people adhering to this honor code__. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of our goals for this homework and bakeoff is to encourage you to engage in __the basic development cycle for supervised models__, in which you\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a new system. We recommend starting with something simple.\n",
    "1. Use `sst.experiment` to evaluate your system, using random train/test splits initially.\n",
    "1. If you have time, compare your system with others using `sst.compare_models` or `utils.mcnemar`. (For discussion, see [this notebook section](sst_02_hand_built_features.ipynb#Statistical-comparison-of-classifier-models).)\n",
    "1. Return to step 1, or stop the cycle and conduct a more rigorous evaluation with hyperparameter tuning and assessment on the `dev` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Error analysis](#Error-analysis) is one of the most important methods for steadily improving a system, as it facilitates a kind of human-powered hill-climbing on your ultimate objective. Often, it takes a careful human analyst just a few examples to spot a major pattern that can lead to a beneficial change to the feature representations."

    "\n",
    "You don't have to use the experimental framework defined below (based on `sst`). The only constraint we need to place on your system is that it must have a `predict_one` method that can map directly from an example text to a prediction, and it must be able to make predictions without having any information beyond the text. (For example, it can't depend on knowing which task the text comes from.) See [the bakeoff section below](#Bakeoff-[1-point]) for examples of functions that conform to this specification."
